Lab8
====

### Overview
During this lab, you will combine the previous laboratory assignments and program your robot to autonomously 
navigate through a maze. On the last day of the lab, each section will hold a competition to see who can solve 
the maze the fastest. The fastest time in ECE 382 will have their name engraved on a plaque in the CSD lab. Believe 
it or not, the main goal of this lab is for you to have some fun with computer engineering!

###Requirements

You must write a program that autonomously navigates your robot through a maze (Figure 1) while meeting the following requirements:

Your robot must always start at the home position.
Your robot is considered successful only if it finds one of the three exits and moves partially out of the maze.
A large portion of your grade depends on which door you exit.
Door 1 - Required Functionality
Door 2 - B Functionality
Door 3 - A Functionality
You cannot hit a wall!
Bonus! Navigate from the A door back to the entrance using the same algorithm.
You cannot hit a wall!
Your robot must solve the maze in less than three minutes.
Your robot will be stopped if it touches the wall more than twice.
Your robot must use the IR sensors to find its path through the maze.

Do not step onto the maze since the floor will not support your weight. You will notice the maze floor is cracked 
from cadets who ignored this advice.

The Prelab can be found attached. I did this on time and recieved a 9 out of 10 on this section.

For the Required Functionality, I ended up going with a wall hugging algorithm for my robot. The video can be seen below.
